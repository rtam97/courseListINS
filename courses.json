In addition, cell biology methods for expression analysis of transgenes (GTP-fusion proteins) or endogenous proteins (using specific antibodies) in relation to the genetic background are part of the lab’s standard repertoire. More specialised methods that are used are exogenous stimulation of neurons in C. elegans by light, transmitted by the transgene expressed, photo-activated cation channel rhodopsin-2, as well as electrophysiological conductance from C. elegans muscle cells (the latter only as a demonstration, since the method is too complicated to learn in 6 weeks).

Basically, using bioacoustics tools, the students will try to figure out the vocal alphabet of bats and gerbils. The second part of the course deals with the receiver. In this part, the students will learn how the gerbil’s voice is processed in the brain by neurons located in the auditory cortex. The main aim here is to assess what happens in the brain when an animal hears a behaviorally relevant sound. At the beginning of each course part, there will be introductory discussions that will provide the students with the necessary theoretical background for conducting and understanding the different experiments. An introduction to statistics and to MATLAB will also be offered. The final report will be written in the form of a scientific paper, and the results will be presented in the form of a short talk."

(4) Understand basic neuroscience concepts such as: action potential, local field potential, receptive field, brain topography, spike clustering, brain oscillations.

    "content":"The practical course offers basic theoretical and experimental knowledge in the area of neurodegenerative and vascular disorders. The students work on their own projects under supervision and present the results in the form of a seminar talk. This talk also includes an original publication from the field of their projects. By writing a result protocol, they will learn how to write scientific reports. The practical course consists of systemic, cellular and molecular aspects that will be addressed using transgenic mouse models. This includes the following techniques: in vivo 2-Photon Microscopy, Image- and data analysis, basic mouse genetic techniques, processing of brain tissue for immunohistochemistry, basic primary cell culture techniques, immunofluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy as well as biochemical techniques including protein gel electrophoresis and Western blotting."
    ,
    "objectives":"In this elective module the student will learn fundamental techniques used to in the research area of neurodegenerative disorders (as described above). In vivo 2-Photon imaging enables us to record systemic as well as cellular processes in real time. The students are presented with the opportunity to observe in vivo animal handling and the live imaging process. The acquired data will be analyzed by the students, teaching them basic Image- and data analysis skills. The immunohistochemical stainings of brain sections will teach the students the technique as well as the underlying scientific question of the experiment. Moreover, the students will work with cultured cells under sterile conditions, with the epifluorescence – and stereo microscope. The students are in an international environment and learn how to write and communicate their results in English."

    "content":"Humans may not be good at multitasking – but their brains are! Cognitive processes such as learning and attention are often represented in the same brain areas, at the same time. Previous research has overwhelmingly focused on how each of these processes affects neuronal activity in isolation. In contrast, in our lab we study how neuronal activity represents such cognitive processes simultaneously, and whether this is evolutionarily preserved or varies across species. For this, we conduct parallel experiments in monkeys and mice. These animals are trained to do naturalistic foraging tasks in a virtual environment, while we record the activity of large neuronal populations in their visual system. Since the lab is still in the build-up phase, what you would do is various. Depending on when you come, you get experience in mouse/monkey handling and training, Matlab/Python programming, psychophysics, virtual reality (VR), and in-vivo electrophysiology."
    ,
    "objectives":"In this elective module the students will get exposed to all the techniques necessary for in-vivo electrophysiology: handling of animals (mice and/or monkeys), training the animals on a natural task in a virtual environment, surgeries to implant electrodes, and electrophysiological recordings from these electrodes as the animals are doing their task. In addition, the students can do some psychophysics on human subjects in the VR, and they will get their own data analysis project, which will allow them to learn Matlab/Python programming. The students are in an international environment and learn how to write and communicate their results in English."

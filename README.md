Small website created for the [INS Master Programme](https://www.izn-frankfurt.de/en/master/) at Goethe University Frankfurt.

It allows one to:

1. interactively explore the courses offered and their details 
2. filter them based on type/location/semester/model/techniques
3. drag-drop the ones that you are interested in into a 'selection-box'
4. view your selections together to compare them
5. save your selection to your PC and load your saved ones
